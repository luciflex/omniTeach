        <i>"Excellent course. Jonas explains the core concepts in javascript that are usually glossed over in other
            courses. And he
            does it in a manner that is clear and concise."</i> — John Collins

        Do you want to learn the number #1 programming language that powers the internet?

        Are you tired of wasting your time and money on random youtube videos or JavaScript courses that are either too
        simple,
        or too difficult to follow?

        Or are you struggling to deeply understand and apply JavaScript to real projects?

        If your answer is a big YES... Then this is exactly the course you are looking for!
        <h3 class="fourth">Who this course is for: </h3>
        <ul>
            <i class="fa fa-check-circle">Take this course if you want to get started with programming in general:
                JavaScript is a great language
                to learn how to
                code.</i><br><br>
            <i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Take this course if you're interested in using popular
                libraries/frameworks like React, Angular or Node.
            </i><br><br>
            <i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Take this course if you have taken other JavaScript courses but: 1)
                still don't really understand
                JavaScript, or 2)
                still don't feel confident to code real-world apps. This course is perfect for you!</i><br><br>

                Jonas takes great care to really explain how things work under the hood, so you don't feel like you're
                just copying
                code—you're actually understanding what you're writing, and why. In particular, I appreciate that Jonas
                doesn't edit out
                the little missteps along the way. Instead, he uses each one as a chance to show students how to
                problem-solve like a
                developer: what to type into Google when you're stuck, how to get to the bottom of an error message,
                etc.
